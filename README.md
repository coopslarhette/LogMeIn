# LogMeIn
just for fun project that tries to create simple log-in system

## project outline
* currently it operates out of the terminal. will probably remain a proof of concept (might try and work it into some kind of web shell). 
* uses sha512 hashing and unique randomly generated salts to implement some kind of cryptographic security
